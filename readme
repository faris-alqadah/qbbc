QBBC stands for Query Based Bi-Clustering. This is an implementation of the QBBC algorithm as described in "Query-Based Bi-Clustering using Formal Concept Analysis" by Alqadah et al. which appears in the SDM 2012 conference.

To see synopsis of the program run ./bin/qbbc


USAGE: test -i input_file 
REQUIRED: 
-i <inputFile>
-q <domain_id> <queryFile>
OPTIONAL: 
-alpha <alpha value> (default is 1.0)
-c <consistency function> 1- alpha_sigma 2- max_space_uniform (default is 1)
-o <output file path>

	
	

INPUT FILE FORMAT:

The input file should follow this strict format:
<num_domains> (2) ( this should always be 2 as bi-clustering only invovles 2 domains)
<num_contexts> (1) ( this should always be 1 as bi-clustering only invovles a single context)
<name_of_domain_1>
<path_to_name_file_domain_1>
.
.
.
<name_of_domain_n>
<path_to_name_file_domain_n>
<name_of_domain_i> -- <name_of_domain_j>
<path_to_fimi_file_of_context_i_j>
.
.
.
<name_of_domain_s> -- <name_of_domain_t>	
<path_to_sparse_matrix_file_of_context_s_t>

NAME FILE FORMAT:
each object name should be listed on a seperate line

SPARSE MATRIX FILE FORMAT:
This is a file format to represent a sparse real valued matrix
Each line of the file corresponds to the (line_num+1)th row
On each are comma seperated entries consisting of pairs <i,value> where i indicates the the (i+1)th column with value 'value'.
The final line of the file should contain the characters '###' and nothing else, to denote the end of the file



EXAMPLE INPUT FILE:
2
1
nums
/Users/alqadaf/Research/Data/toy/num.names
atts
/Users/alqadaf/Research/Data/toy/atts.names
nums--atts
/Users/alqadaf/Research/Data/toy/num_atts.mat

So this input file specifies 2 domains and a single context.
The first domain is called 'nums' and the second is 'atts'.
The context nums--atts consists of the domains 'nums' and 'atts' and is represented by the sparse matrix file
'num_atts.mat'. Since 'nums' is the first domains the rows of 'num_atts.mat' correspond to the 'nums' domain
and columns correspond to the 'atts' domain.

QUERY FILE
The query file should contain query terms one per line. These query terms must correspond to objects names in one of the name files in the input file.





BEWARE OF:
 1) CR characters from windows files! User must remove these
 2) Extra white lines or LF at the end of any of the files. The program
 	will interepet thse as extra row / columns of a domain or context
 3) Indexing always start at 0, as described above.
 4) To specify a context in the input file, the same domain names specified in the input file
 	in the top lines must be used again to specify the context.
 5) The order of the domains when specifying a context matters (as described above).

 
 SAMPLE RUN OF QBBC:
 
 
 ./bin/qbbc -i nums.input -q 1 query_file.txt -alpha 3.0 -c 1 -o result
 assuming nums.input is the correct path this will produce files result.concepts and result.concepts.names containing the query-based bi-clusters.
